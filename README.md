# Chess_Game
A chess game fully implemented in JAVA, the interface is built with Java fx.
The user can play againts another human player or a bot.
The bot is implemented using a minimax algorithm with a depth of 3, and has alpha beta pruning implemented.
98% of this project including interface, bot, events, board and pieces etc ... is written by me while a couple of methods were written by my colleague at the university.
